##  This is Diamond Creek.

The nicest course nobody has heard of is hidden behind a non-distinctive entry way in Banner Elk North Carolina and that's exactly the way the members like it.  Built in 2003 this course was designed to be anything but easy. Sitting at [#88 on the Golf Digest Top 100 Courses in America](assets/top100.pdf) Diamond Creek is a gem.

The experience starts on the drive in... Or wait,  for some the helicopter ride in.

Yup, Diamond Creek has it's own helicopter... For those among us that's don't usually fly in helicopters, the entry via car is pretty special too.  As you drive in you pass by [Artisanal](http://www.artisanalnc.com/) which is a world class restaurant that is a must while in Banner Elk.
